# Local TTS Studio - Release v1.0.0 🚀

Welcome to the first official release of Local TTS Studio! This update introduces brand new features to enhance your workflow and introduces our powerful new over-the-air (OTA) auto-updater.

## ✨ New Features & Improvements

### 🔄 Over-The-Air (OTA) Updates
- **Seamless Upgrades**: Future updates can now be installed with a single click inside the app. If a newer version is detected on GitHub, an "Update Available" banner will appear at the top of the interface.
- **Zero Configuration**: Simply click "Update Now," and the application will completely download, extract, and cleanly install the newest version in the background before restarting itself.

### 📝 Editable Paragraphs
- **Interactive Parsing**: The paragraph parsing list is now fully interactive. The plain text inside generation cards now functions as an invisible text box.
- **Smart Regeneration**: Clicking and editing a paragraph that has already finished generating will immediately flag the paragraph with a yellow `Regenerate` badge, allowing you to quickly spot and fix mistakes or tweak the sentence structure without generating the entire file.

### 🎨 UI & UX Polish
- **Layout Optimization**: We've consolidated the settings panel. The "Mode" drop-down and the voice configuration options (like "Saved Profile" or "Speaker Select") now sit side-by-side cleanly, saving valuable vertical screen space.
- **Intelligent Download Button**: The "Download Audio" option has been reworked. It now stays visible but is *disabled (greyed out)* until every single parsed paragraph is successfully marked as `Ready`, ensuring incomplete audio cannot be merged.
- **New App Icon**: A sleek new logo (compiled in full resolution `.icns` format) is now embedded directly into the macOS `.app` bundle.

## 📥 Installation

1. Download `Local_TTS_Studio.zip` from the **Assets** section below.
2. Unzip the file.
3. Drag the extracted `Local TTS Studio.app` into your `/Applications` folder.
4. Open the application. *(Note: Upon first launch, you may need to right-click and select "Open" to bypass macOS Gatekeeper).*

Enjoy running extremely fast, top-tier intelligent TTS natively on your device!
